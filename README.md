# title: The Great Escape: How to Become an Entrepreneur, and Never be Poor Again!
Knowledge + Hard Work &amp; Determination = Wealth!

Give people a ¨Life &amp; Career Plan¨ and explain everything about Business, Finance, Personal Finance, & Wealth. 
also in the end tell my entire story from senior year in high school (studying Internet Marketing) until now.

# Inspired by:
- Anthony Viccino - ¨Amplified Impact¨
- Robert Kiyosaki´s books & Courses
- Simon Dixon´s work
- Daniel Freeman´s ¨RiseAndGrind.com¨ & ¨How to make a Dollar out of 15 cents¨

# Outline:
- Including a chapter on Investing. A Chapter on Money & Prescious Metals, and a chapter on Bitcoin & Blockchain technology
- A chapter on School (University) Vs. Trades & Community Collage
- A section on Quick ways to get $100K/year so you can invest or start a business with. example: Network Engineer CCNA CCNP etc., CDL Truck driver. For these because I don´t have experience there, Weĺl have Guest Authors write most of that chapter! Pick 7 ¨entry Porfessions¨ as examples.
